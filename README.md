# IIS361 - Create Analytical SAP Fiori Apps Quickly and Efficiently

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2020 session called IIS361 - Create Analytical SAP Fiori Apps Quickly and Efficiently  

## Overview

In this exercise, you will learn how to create an SAP Fiori application using SAP Fiori elements

In our use case, we want to create an app that allows a sales manager to have an overview of all the sales orders created in the past months, to analyse the sales figures through different dimensions (e.g. time or customer) and see detailed information about a specific sales order item

At the end of the exercise, the app will consist of 2 screens. The first screen leverages the “analytical list page” template and displays a collection of sales order items in a chart and a table, with analytics and filtering capabilities. The second screen uses the “object page” template to display details about a sales order item


## Requirements

You will need to have a computer with Internet access, a browser (preferably Google Chrome), and access to your email in the event that you need to create an SAP Cloud Platform trial account
